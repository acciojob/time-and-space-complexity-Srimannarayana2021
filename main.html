	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity defines how an algorithm's runtime scales with respet to the size of input.It gives an idea how efficient an algorithm is working. </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory used for an algorithm ,it is expressed in terms of O(n).</p>
